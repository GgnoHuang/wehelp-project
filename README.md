## 🟠 [Taipei-day-trip](http://54.65.60.124:3000/)

> Taipei-day-trip is a travel e-commerce platform, this website features comprehensive introductions to tourist attractions along with shopping cart and transaction payment functionalities.

- The front-end is developed using **`Vanilla JavaScript`** for all page interactions and integrates with **`APIs`** to render attraction information and images in the views.
- Use **`Python's Flask`** framework to set up routes, and build a **`MySQL`** database for keeping all the member data.
- The back-end routing uses **`RESTful API`** design for **`CRUD`**. This makes the front-end and back-end work better separately.
- Use **`JWT`** to authenticate or verify member tokens, aligning with the **`'Stateless'`** principle of RESTful APIs.
- Create an **`Ubuntu`**-based **`Amazon EC2`** instance and deploy the project to it, then associate an **`Elastic IP`** with the instance for stable external access.
